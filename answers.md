1. Internet backbone is the core of the internet, the links between it's biggest and most important servers. Without the internet backbone, the internet falls apart without basis
2. Clients are the users, servers are the datacenters and hosts. Clients send information to the server, and the server sends info back. Clients generally run off user input, and servers are generally fully automated and only demand occasional maintenance.
3. Servers are, as previously explained, the datacenters and managers of the internet. Everything sends data to servers, servers manage data, and send the new cool data back to the cool internet users. Routers connect devices to the internet, simply functioning as a tunnel to pass the data from computer to internet. Computers are the devices used to do all this, running programs and connecting to servers to provide users with a good experience
4. The Internet Protocol Suite is a set of four "layers" used to communicate data over the internet. Eachlayer has several tools to do generally the same thing. Any message will use one tool from each layer, but never multiple from a single layer. The link layer is your connection to the internet, being either wireless or wired, through ethernet. The network layer is based around the usage of IP to track systems and link them from one to another. The transport layer is used to actually move the data from system A to B, using different systems to ultimately achieve the same goal. And the top layer, the application layer, is used to actually show us the things we want
5. Social media, video games, streaming. 
6. Hypertext is links to other websites, documents, or portions in the current document labelled as blue, underlined bits of text.
7. The Web is a general term for our common idea of the internet. I'd categorize it as most things found and used in web browsers, including social media, forums, and information websites. Whilst games and applications use the internet, I would not categorize them as part of "the web"
8. HTTP is the communications protocol used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or on a local network. (Not stolen, I swear, totally not plaigarized, nooooope!)
9. HTTPS is very similar to HTTP, but more secure as it uses SSL and packet signatures to verify it's the actual message supposed to be sent.
10. Web 1.0 was the initial version of the internet, with very little communication between client and server. Most of the time, servers would just send info to the clients. Some limited forums have the capability to send messages to the server, but they still required a refresh to see any new content. Web 2.0 is what we are in now, with active and constant communication between client and server. Web 3.0 is a theoretical but ultimately unlikely version of the internet that could happen, centering around decentralization, cryptocurrencies, and "lack of internet ownership," meaning that small people could do just as well as big companies.
11. Kinda just did thsi
12. Markup languages are used to make websites look like anything more then text documents with white backgrounds. By splitting things into sections, uploading images and using CSS to make them stylish.
13. Scripting languages are made to do things, markup languages are just schmancy formatting
14. SGML, XML, HTML, XHTML, DHTML, and Markdown are ALL methods to create and format websites, with differing but generally similar commands. They all achieve the same thing, but with different degrees of precision and ease of use.
15. Pertaining to this course, I like videogames, believe the internet should be free (as in freedom AND price), believe that net neutrality is Very Important, have used the internet in the past, and have done some basic courses in programming
16. maybe I could be a web designer i dunno
